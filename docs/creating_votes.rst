Creating votes
==============

The process of creating votes is split in several steps.
The first steps are to be done in the admin.

Creating votes
##############

To create a vote, simply navigate to the admin section for the votes and create a vote.

A name, a begin date and an end date are required.
If you want to restrict this vote to some groups, you can do so by selecting groups. The user will have to be in **one of the groups** to participate in the vote.

The name and description can be translated.

Adding questions
################

One the vote created, you need to create questions. Each question is linked to one vote ( question cannot be reused in several votes).
The text of the question is required and can be translated.

Adding answers
##############

Next for each question you have created, you need to populate the possible answers for that question. 

An answer is linked to one question and cannot be reused for another question or vote.

The text of the answer is required and can be translated.

Adding documents
################

It is possible to add documents to a vote. They will be displayed during the vote process to the users.

A name and a document are required and can be translated.

Make the vote ready
###################

Once you are happy with your vote, and preferably before the beginning of the vote, you should make your vote ready.

This action can be done in the admin with the action bar, or in the interface on the votes index, that makes a recap of all questions, answers and documents.

.. note:: Users cannot access a vote if it is not ready

.. warning:: Once a vote is ready, you cannot change the ready state. Also, you cannot add questions or answers to the vote.
